This repository contains the code used for the second year Masters research project. The code used is divided into three parts:

* run_lightweight_salon.sh - BASH script for quantifying reads from raw ME/CFS FASTQ files. Requires initial creation of index file (included as a comment in a code);

* rnaseq-microarray-dge-wgcna.ipynb - R script for data preprocessing, DGE analysis and WGCNA for microarray and RNAseq data;

* classification_enrichment_analysis.ipynb - R script for binomial and multiclass classification folowing enrichment analysis.

Additionally, _enrichment_results_merged.xlsx_ table contains GO, DO and HPO enrichment analysis results, and quant_files folder containes _salmon_ output (quant and log files) for RNAseq samples.
