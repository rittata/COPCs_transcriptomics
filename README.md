This repository contains the code used for the second year Masters research project. The code used is divided into three parts:

* run_lightweight_salon.sh - BASH script for quantifying reads from raw ME/CFS FASTQ files. Requires initial creation of index file (included as a comment in a code);

* FM_DGE_and_logregression.ipynb - R script for data preprocessing and DGE analysis for fibromyalgia dataset, following the development of Lasso logistic regression model for disease risk prediction;

*  ME-CFS_DGE_and_classification.ipynb - R script to perform DGE analysis and multiclass classification for three ME/CFS datasets.
